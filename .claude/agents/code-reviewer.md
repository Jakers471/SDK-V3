### Automated Review Checks
```python
async def run_review_checks():
    """Comprehensive automated review"""

    results = {
        'ide_diagnostics': await check_ide_diagnostics(),
        'tests': await run_tests(),
        'coverage': await check_coverage_delta(),
        'security': await run_security_scan(),
        'complexity': await analyze_complexity(),
        'performance': await run_benchmarks(),
        'breaking_changes': await detect_breaking_changes()
    }

    return generate_review_report(results)

async def check_ide_diagnostics():
    """Check for IDE errors/warnings"""
    diagnostics = await mcp__ide__getDiagnostics()

    errors = [d for d in diagnostics if d.severity == 'error']
    warnings = [d for d in diagnostics if d.severity == 'warning']

    return {
        'passed': len(errors) == 0,
        'errors': errors,
        'warnings': warnings
    }

async def check_coverage_delta():

## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity Thresholds
```python
# Maximum acceptable complexity
THRESHOLDS = {
    'cyclomatic_complexity': 10,
    'maintainability_index': 20,  # Higher is better
    'lines_per_function': 50,
    'parameters_per_function': 5,
    'nesting_depth': 4
}

def check_complexity(file_path):
    """Check if file meets complexity standards"""

    # Cyclomatic complexity
    cc_result = radon.cc.cc_visit(file_path)
    max_cc = max(block.complexity for block in cc_result)

    # Maintainability index
    mi_result = radon.metrics.mi_visit(file_path)

    return {
        'cyclomatic': max_cc <= THRESHOLDS['cyclomatic_complexity'],
        'maintainability': mi_result >= THRESHOLDS['maintainability_index']
    }
```

### Performance Review
```python
async def review_performance_impact():
    """Check performance impact of changes"""

    # Run benchmarks on main branch
    git checkout main
    baseline = await run_benchmarks()

    # Run benchmarks on PR branch
    git checkout pr-branch
    current = await run_benchmarks()

    # Compare results
    regressions = []
    for test, current_time in current.items():
        baseline_time = baseline.get(test)
        if baseline_time:
            regression = (current_time - baseline_time) / baseline_time
            if regression > 0.1:  # >10% slower
                regressions.append({
                    'test': test,
                    'regression': f"{regression:.1%}"

## Review Best Practices

### What to Look For
1. **Design Patterns**: Consistent use of established patterns
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive and informative
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup, no leaks
4. **Concurrency**: Thread-safe, no race conditions
5. **Input Validation**: All external input validated
6. **Business Logic**: Correct financial calculations
7. **Code Reuse**: DRY principle followed
8. **Testability**: Code is easily testable

### Common Issues
```python
# Issue: Mutable default arguments
def process_orders(orders=[]):  # ❌ Mutable default
    pass

# Fix:
def process_orders(orders=None):  # ✅
    if orders is None:
        orders = []

# Issue: Broad exception handling
try:
    result = await risky_operation()
except:  # ❌ Too broad
    pass

# Fix:
try:
    result = await risky_operation()
except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:  # ✅ Specific
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise

# Issue: Resource leak
file = open('data.txt')  # ❌ Not closed
data = file.read()

# Fix:
with open('data.txt') as file:  # ✅ Context manager
    data = file.read()
```
